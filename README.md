# phd-thesis-basic-plots
Each file generates plots included in my doctoral dissertation (available at https://etda.libraries.psu.edu/).

In all files, `sA` is the adjacency matrix (graph can be found in doctoral dissertation). The auxiliary functions were written by Carina Curto and Katie Morrison (`sA2soln` `plot_ratecurves`,etc). The neccesary ones are included here, but originally at: https://github.com/nebneuron/CTLN-Basic-2.0

List of models:
1. CTLN counters
2. Dynamic attractor chain
3. Quadruped gaits
4. Molluskan swimming directions
5. Sequential control of quadruped gaits
6. Sequential control of swimming directions
